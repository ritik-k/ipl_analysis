# Indian Premier League Data Aanalysis

## As a cricket fan and a Data Science enthusiast I decided to perform some Data Analysis on IPL data from 2008 - 2017. Since the 2020 IPL season has been postponed and everyone is getting IPL blues, I decided it would be a good idea to look at some IPL statistics in a different way. The dataset has been sourced from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/manasgarg/ipl/data). The dataset contains IPL match data from 2008 - 2017.

## Based on the data, these were the main questions I focused on answering:
1. What are the biggest margins of victory by runs?
2. Calculating success of a team (No of matches won / No of matches played)
3. Does winning the toss give a big advantage?
4. Which are the players with the most Man of the Match awards?
5. Calculating a team's Win/Loss percentage in home and away matches?
6. How many matches has a team played against other teams?
7. What are the Win/Lose percentages of a team at different grounds?

## In this exploratory data analysis, I found out answers to these questions and more with my trusty friend; data.
